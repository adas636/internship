# internship
I started coding basically because of my studies. The lectures were so interesting the same as given tasks and also final project in which we were supposed to add some features to created game in the way that it doesn't disturb other people with they part of the game.
Some of them required long hours of work but still the results were the same that I was more into these field
I think that this field allows for development in many directions so it's another reaon why I've applied for this position.
